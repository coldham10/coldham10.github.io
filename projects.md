		<p>From analyzing COVID-19 data and predicting turning points, to writing CLI-based screensavers for a Raspberry Pi, to attempting automated crossword-puzzle building &mdash; I'm always trying things, learning, and building something. My more major projects make it on to my GitHub, of which the following are my favourites.</p>

				</header>

I had just taught myself JavaScript and React, so I decided to write a React Native app to help me keep track. Continuum is now available as a beta on the Android Play Store.</p>
